100 Days Of Code - Log

Day 1: January 21, 2017

Today's Progress: Worked on utilizing class in html for managing site design.

Thoughts: CSS and java are not a strong suit. In fact I know very little. I have an understanding of functionality but an understanding of the language as if it were latin (I do no speak latin)

Day 2: January 22, 2017 

Today's Progress: Adding in bootstrap to round out CSS usage for dynamic sites.

Thoughts: The foundations are easy to understand, but I still struggle with understanding the implementation in the background.
